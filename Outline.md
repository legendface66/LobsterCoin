Supply chains composed of production, processing and distribution elements experience inefficencies between links as a result of increased handling instances and additional storage needed to buffer supply. Further inefficencies result from the degredation of perishable goods held between production and processing. This is passed down to the producer as a lower price per production unit. 
Poor communication between processors and producers, middlemen, lack of competition


The example I am going to use is the Maine lobster fishery, where catch rates fluctuate by hundreds of percent with only a general degree of predictability, the product is highly perishable, and preparing processing capacity takes significant advance planning.

Tokens, representing the right to a proportion of processing capacity, combined with a feed supplying capacity updates can streamline communication between producers and processors. By allowing the tokens to be traded, capacity can be reallocated from underperforming producers to overperformers at a market rate, reducing varience in returns accross a primary industry within the supply chain.
